# bug-buddy
Bug buddy is a simple bug tracking/help desk CLI program created using
Java and MongoDB. I created this program as a custom personal solution to 
track bugs and issues that I encounter while working on my projects.

Feel free to download and use the Maven project. Any constructive criticism is welcome.
## Features
The program is it's current form has most of the essential functionality to be 
useful for regular use. Bug buddy currently supports:

* Creating bug reports.
* Adding updates and progress reports to individual reports.
* Keeping track of report status as solved or in progress.
* Displaying bug report data in the console.
* Deleting bug reports.

I will be adding more features as I use the program and find shortcomings in it's current state.
## Instructions
* Simply create a MongoDB data base locally or on a cloud provider of your choice.

* Insert the MongoDB data base URI in line 12 of src/main/java/com/bugbuddy/App.java.

* Once that's done you're off to the races!
